Log::Dispatch is a suite of OO modules for logging messages to
multiple outputs, each of which can have a minimum and maximum log
level.  It is designed to be easily subclassed, both for creating a
new dispatcher object and particularly for creating new outputs.

History

1.008

- Fixed a bug causing unitialized value warnings with -w (oops).
- Fixed a minor mistake in Log::Dispatch::Syslog docs (thanks to Ilya
Martynov)
- Put newlines into messages in SYNOPSIS sections for some modules.
This is to clarify that you need to do this.  Just to be clear,
Log::Dispatch does not alter message content in any manner whatsoever
(and never will).  However, it would be trivial to subclass
Log::Dispatch to do this.

1.007

- First public release.  It passes its own test suite so it should
work (he says hopefully).
