1.76

- New method: Log::Dispatch->level_is_valid($string).  Suggested by
Jeff Hamman.

- Fix for version issues between CPAN versions of
Log::Dispatch::ApacheLog.  Reported by Jost Krieger.

1.75

- Additional argument 'level' passed to message processing callbacks.
Suggested by Jeff MacDonald.
- Log/Dispatch.pm: added docs section on Log::Dispatch::Tk.

1.7

- Added Log/Dispatch/ApacheLog.pm.  This logs to the Apache error log.
This is for use under mod_perl.

1.6

NOTE: 1.5 was never released to CPAN.

- Log/Dispatch.pm: Added convenience methods for log levels like
$dispatcher->alert($message).  Suggested by Dominique Dumont.

1.5

This version introduces some changes into the interface that will
cause incompatibility with any Log::Dispatch::Output interface you may
have created.  However, it is fairly simple to fix.  Simply change the
method in your subclass named 'log' to be called 'log_message'.  You
can also remove the line:

  return unless $self->_should_log($params{level});

This is now done before the message ever gets to the Output subclass
(which is what it should have done in the first place, really.)

This was done so that I could allow per-Output object callbacks, a
feature which several people have requested and which seems useful
enough to warrant the breakage.

NOTE: This change is transparent if you are only using the Output
objects included with this distribution.

- Many: Changed the interface to allow per-Output object level
callbacks and documented this.
- Log/Dispatch/Base.pm: new base class for both Log::Dispatch and
Log::Dispatch::Output objects (contains callback related code).  You
should never need to deal with this class unless you are me.
- Log/Dispatch/Output.pm: document _accepted_levels.
- Log/Dispatch/Output.pm: Fix _accepted_levels so that emergency level
is returned as 'emergency', not 'emerg'.
- Log/Dispatch.pm: Fix doc bug (change 'file' to 'filename').  Thanks
to Clayton Scott.
- Log/Dispatch/File.pm: Do compile time check for O_APPEND constant
rather than run time check.

1.2

- Log/Dispatch.pm: Added callbacks parameter to Log::Dispatch->new.  I
will also be adding this to the Log::Dispatch::* classes via
Log::Dispatch::Output but I wanted to get this new version out there
because I think there are people out there who would benefit from
this.
- Log/Dispatch.pm: Added docs section on why Log::Dispatch doesn't add
newlines to outgoing messages.

1.11

- Realized I need to tweak the $VERSION in Log::Dispatch

1.1

- upped version to 1.1 to indicate my confidence in this release (I'm
just asking for bug reports, I know).
- added accepted_levels method to Log::Dispatch::Output based on
discussions with Dominique Dumont (author of the Log::Dispatch::Tk
suite).
- canonical names for log levels are now the unabbreviated form
(though the abbreviated ones used by syslog are still fine and there
is no plan to deprecate them).  This really only affects what is
returned by the new accepted_levels method.

1.010

- fixed a bug in the DESTROY method of Log::Dispatch::Email that
caused an annoying error and may have caused spurious emails to be
sent (thanks to Radu Greab).
- fixed a bug in Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSendmail.  For some reason
this module demands a 'from' address.

1.009

- Created this version simply to address an issue with CPAN and my
internal version numbers having a conflict.  This has no changes from
1.008.

1.008

- Fixed a bug causing unitialized value warnings with -w (oops).
- Fixed a minor mistake in Log::Dispatch::Syslog docs (thanks to Ilya
Martynov)
- Put newlines into messages in SYNOPSIS sections for some modules.
This is to clarify that you need to do this.  Just to be clear,
Log::Dispatch does not alter message content in any manner whatsoever
(and never will).  However, it would be trivial to subclass
Log::Dispatch to do this.

1.007

- First public release.  It passes its own test suite so it should
work (he says hopefully).
